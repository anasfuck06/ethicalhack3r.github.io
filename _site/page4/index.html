        <section class="post-excerpt">
            Yesterday two Indian security researchers, Aditya Modha & Samir Shah, released an <a href="http://oldmanlab.blogspot.com/2012/01/wordpress-33-xss-vulnerability.html" target="_blank">advisory</a> outlining a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the latest version (at the time of writing) of WordPress 3.3. Many people started re-tweeting the news (including myself) and <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2012/01/zero-day-reflected-cross-site-scripting.html" target="_blank">blogging</a> about it. The problem came when I tried to reproduce the vulnerability, I couldn't.

I started to think that the vulnerability was a miss-understanding or publicity stunt and was getting annoyed at the many people who were spreading miss-information. I contacted the researchers over <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oldmanlab" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and told them that I was unable to reproduce the vulnerability in any browser or on any WordPress installation including vanilla installs.

The researchers got back in touch with a link to a WordPress installation on which the vulnerability worked. The URL they gave me was an IP address. Within their environment the XSS worked.

At this point I think even the researchers were puzzled. They sent me this code that they believed was the function causing the XSS within wp-includes/functions.php <a href="http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm</a>.

            The EC-Council or 'The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants' as they like to call themselves offer a range of different services, mostly in the field of Information Security training and certifications. One of their certifications, the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) claims to aspire to training 'ethical' hackers. 

<blockquote>"CEHv7 provides a comprehensive ethical hacking and network security-training program to meet the standards of highly skilled security professionals."</blockquote>

What I have found is the way the EC-Council promote their CEH is less than ethical and damn right unethical.

A comment left on my blog quite a while ago (2010/04/20 at 6:18 am), looked fairly authentic, however, when investigating a little further it was clear to me that the comment was in fact SPAM.

<blockquote>"smith said...
Hey folks, Thanks for sharing your views,article includes a very good information about the ethical hacking, the most interesting job in the field of computer security is being an ethical hacker,so i striven into the field of CEH, for more information on CEH check this link http://www.eccouncil.org/certification/certified_ethical_hacker.aspx"</blockquote>

            As part of my on-going interest in WordPress security I wanted to find out for myself what the state of security was like on installations in the wild.

A list of servers running WordPress was acquired from <a href="http://www.shodanhq.com/" target="_blank">Shodan</a> by searching for a particular HTTP response header and its value. The list contained 10,000 entries, I don't know for sure, but I assume the list contained servers from around the world and was fairly random.

An Open Source project I have been working on, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wpscan/" target="_blank">WPScan</a>, a WordPress security scanner, was used to passively scan 100 of those WordPress installations. This was done partly to test the scanner for any defects and also to gather data about the security of WordPress installations in the wild.

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            Many people including developers, vendors and security professionals believe that Full Path Disclosure (FPD) is mainly a Security Misconfiguration problem rather than a Input Sanitation or Error Handling problem. I'm not saying that they are wrong, but I hope to convince them that it is more of a coding bug than a configuration bug. I want to put my argument over as to why I think FPD is a bug in source code and not in configuration. 

<strong>What is Full Path Disclosure (FPD)?</strong>

According to OWASP:
"Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view."
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure" target="_blank">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure</a>

For me this is a very vague description of what FPD really is. FPD occurs when a web application encounters an error that is displayed to the user; the error includes the full path to the file the error occurred in possibly along with other debugging information.

<strong>Why is it a problem?</strong>

It's just the path of the file from the root directory, what's all the fuss about?

Ayer (o el anterior) Microsoft hizo disponible "Windows 8 Developer Preview" para cualquier persona poder descargar. Yo hize la instalación en <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> siguiendo este <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/RollingIT/archive/2011/09/14/getting-hands-on-with-virtual-machine-of-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank">guía</a> (en Ingles).

Quería ver si Microsoft posiblemente han usado algunas librerías/programas de versiones de Windows antiguos que posiblemente tengan vulnerabilidades remotos y que el <a href="http://metasploit.com/" target="_blank">Metesploit</a> tenga un exploit para el.

Para esto quería usar el db_autopwn para que Metasploit use todos los exploits que tenga para los puertos que Windows 8 Developer tenga abierto. Al mismo ves será un test rápido y sencillo.

            I was playing around with getting <a href="http://www.randomstorm.com/wpscan-security-tool.php" target="_blank">wpscan</a> to run through the <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a> network so I needed to setup Tor (from source) and <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/" target="_blank">Privoxy</a> on <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/" target="_blank">BackTrack</a>. These are the steps I took to setup Tor and Privoxy on Backtrack 5 R1. (wpscan does not yet support scanning through the Tor network)

I am no Tor expert and there are probably easier/better ways of doing this.

<strong>Installing Tor (Anonymous SOCKS proxy):</strong>

<blockquote>
$apt-get install libssl-dev
$wget https://www.torproject.org/dist/tor-0.2.2.32.tar.gz

            20th of April 2011 was the first <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage" target="_blank">BSides</a> held in London, <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/27749044/BSidesLondon" target="_blank">BSidesLondon</a>.

Before the event I had been speaking to Space Rouge of <a href="http://www.hackernews.com/" target="_blank">HNN</a> about <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/hnncast-boxee/" target="_blank">getting HNN content on Boxee</a>. I said I would be attending BSidesLondon and volunteered my time to do some recording for them. This would involve some 'promos', interviews and general conference footage.

I was working at <a href="http://www.infosec.co.uk/" target="_blank">InfoSecurity</a> Europe 2011 on the same day. My boss had kindly allowed me to attend the first half of BSidesLondon as long as I worked the second half of the day at InfoSecurity Europe.

After BSidesLondon I sent my footage to HNN for them to edit into an episode of 'Behind the Firewall'. I asked on a couple of occasions if they had chance to put an episode together out of my footage. The last time I asked, last week, I was told that HNN would be shutting down and that my footage would not be used.

Instead of letting the footage go to waste I thought I would stick the <strong>unedited</strong> interviews on YouTube and share them with you all.

            I assume you have all heard about Lulzsec over the past few months so I will not go into their backstory and instead get straight to the point.

Yesterday, 26th June 2011, they released their last data dump on ThePirateBay (TPB) containing usernames and passwords from a few different sources. One of those sources was hackforums.net, I myself had registered here once upon a time. Luckily I had signed up with a disposable password. It turns out however that, yes, that password was leaked in the final lulzsec data dump.

The data dump has now been removed from TPB due to some of the files allegedly being infected with malware. So I found this site which allows you to search for your email address to see if you may have been effected; <a href="http://dazzlepod.com/lulzsec/final/" target="_blank">http://dazzlepod.com/lulzsec/final/</a>

            After creating the <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/wordpress-brute-force-tool/">WordPress Brute Force Tool</a> last weekend, I decided to create a bigger project out of it, called WPScan. 

WPScan is a black box WordPress Security Scanner written in Ruby which attempts to find known security weaknesses within WordPress installations. Its intended use it to be for security professionals or WordPress administrators to asses the security posture of their WordPress installations.
