excerpt: "This week we have another two videos lined up for you. The first, by <a
  href=\"https://twitter.com/haroonmeer\" target=\"_blank\">Haroon Meer</a>, I was
  luckily enough to see in person at Brucon 2011. It is one of the best talks I have
  ever had the privilege to see, by anyone. If you're ever going to watch one of these
  'Weekly Viewing' videos of mine make it be this one.\r\n\r\nThe second video is
  by Matz, the creator of Ruby, where he talks about Ruby's development and the new
  features of Ruby 2.0. In his talk Matz says that Ruby 1.8 will die soon. So update
  already! ;)\r\n\r\n<h1>#HITB2012KUL D1T2 - Haroon Meer - You and Your Research</h1>\r\n\r\n<iframe
