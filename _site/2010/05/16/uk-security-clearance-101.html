        <h1 class="post-title">UK Security Clearance 101</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>In the Information Security industry it is said that if you have security clearance you can earn significantly more income and work on exiting secret projects for government agencies. So what is security clearance and how do I get it?</p>
<p>Security clearance is a way to prove your trustworthiness at a particular point in time so that you can work with sensitive information on government projects. Your trustworthiness is assessed by a thorough background check. There are a number of different security clearance levels depending on the sensitivity of the information which you are required to work with. These levels were changed in the UK during WWII to reflect those of the US so that sensitive information could be shared and the sensitivity of the information not be confused.</p>
<p><strong>National Security Clearances:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Developed Vetting (DV) </strong><br />
This is the highest level of Security Clearance and is required for people with substantial unsupervised access to TOP SECRET assets, or for working in the intelligence or security agencies. This level of clearance involves Security Check (SC) and, in addition, completion of a (DV) questionnaire, financial checks, checking of references and a detailed interview with a vetting officer. To gain (DV) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Security Check (SC)</strong> is for people who have substantial access to SECRET, or occasional access to TOP SECRET assets and information. This level of clearance involves a (BPSS) check plus UK criminal and security checks and a credit check. To gain (SC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)</strong> is required for personnel whose work involves close proximity to public figures, gives access to information or material vulnerable to terrorist attack or involves unrestricted access to certain government or commercial establishments. A (CTC) does not allow access, or knowledge, or custody, of protectively marked assets and information. The check includes a Baseline Personnel Security Standard Check (BPSS) and also a check against national security records. To gain (CTC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</strong> (formally Basic Check)and Enhanced Baseline Standard (EBS) (formerly Enhanced Basic Check or Basic Check +): These are not formal security clearances; they are a package of pre-employment checks that represent good recruitment and employment practice.<br />
A BPSS or EBS aims to provide an appropriate level of assurance as to the trustworthiness, integrity, and probable reliability of prospective employees.  The check is carried out by screening identity documents and references.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>So how do you get security clearance?</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 main security clearing bodies, The Defence Vetting Agency (DVA), Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). Which one you apply for depends on the job contract. To become security cleared by any of the bodies mentioned you will need to be sponsored by a company or individual who has already been security cleared and be offered a contract on a job that requires security clearance in the first place. So in reality there is no way to apply unless you have been offered a contract by a government agency. </p>
<p>If you do get offered a job by a government agency what type of information will they need? For DV vetting they will need financial information, criminal record checks, credit reference checks, security service record checks, references which will be interviewed and a personal interview with a Vetting Officer.</p>
<p>To summarise, you can only be security cleared if you are offered a contract/job that requires it, you need to be sponsored by a company or individual who is already security cleared and they are going to find out more about your life than what you probably do.</p>
