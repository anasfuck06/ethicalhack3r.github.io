<blockquote>Progressive rock legends Marillion are set to perform at a benefit concert for hacker Gary McKinnon.</p>
<p>A concert is being organised to support the hacker, who the US is currently trying to extradite over charges that he caused $700,000 worth of damage when he allegedly hacked into US security systems at NASA and the Pentagon.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would be an excellent way to raise awareness of Gary's case and hopefully encourage a debate regarding the UK/US extradition treaty.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Hemsworth, who is also UK director of the International UFO Congress, plans to organise a â€˜Band Aid style' song recorded at Abbey Road studios and hopes George Michael will sing Mr McKinnon's own single, Only a Fool. All proceeds from the concert will go to the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, after Mr McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in August.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much the tickets would be and what the turn out would be like.</p>
