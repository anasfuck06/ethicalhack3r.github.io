It's almost the end of the year so I thought I would take the opportunity to reflect on my achievements during 2014 before the holidays start. It is a good way for me to put the year into perspective and focus on my goals for 2015.

## Main Achievements

### Learnt Rails
I decided to launch [wpvulndb.com](https://wpvulndb.com) in Rails early on as I already knew Ruby and wanted to learn Rails for a while. This was the perfect opportunity.

### Launched wpvulndb.com
Thanks to BruCON's 5by5 initiative and my fellow WPScan Team members I was able to develop and launch [wpvulndb.com](https://wpvulndb.com).

### Started and stopped selling on markets
Not many people know this but I started a small side business selling traditional British sweets on local French markets. Unfortunately it was a time sink and wasn't very profitable on most days. I decided to stop pursuing this. Although I had great fun learning the basics of practical business. Buying goods and selling them.

### Started Freelancing
I left my reasonably well paid and stable job at RandomStorm where I was happy. I made this decision because I've always wanted to work for myself and it just seemed like the right time to do it. My first 6 months of freelancing have been successful and I hope it will become even more successful in 2015.

I feel my blog post count has been a little low but I can't force myself to write them and I enjoy writing them when I have sudden inspiration. I hope to maybe write more in 2015 but who knows when inspiration will strike.
