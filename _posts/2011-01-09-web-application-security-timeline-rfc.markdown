<p>In order to know where weâ€™re going, we have to understand where we have come from.</p>
<p>I began wondering a couple of days ago, how did we get here? What was the evolution of web application security? To answer this question I decided to put together a Web Application Security Timeline. </p>
<p>The timeline I present to you today is just a start, I hope to make it more comprehensive with feedback from the community. So I ask for your comments!</p>
<ul>
<li>What were the most significant events in the short history of web application security?</li>
<li>What is missing from the timeline?</li>
<li>How would you improve it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Web Application Security Timeline DRAFT<br />
