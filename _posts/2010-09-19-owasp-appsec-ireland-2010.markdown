  9AM and 'officially' ending at 9PM. On my first night in Dublin I went for an excellent
  Italian meal with some great people, these include <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/securityninja\"

  a traditional pint of Guiness in a local pub.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the conference
  I arrived a little early and had some brief discussions with a couple of the attendees.
  The conference kicked off with the keynote talk by John Viega titled \"Application
  Security in the Real World\". This was an excellent talk that put into perspective
  the reality of application security within business. The keynote was followed by
  a brief unplanned summary by Samy Kamkar on his talk which he is touring Europe
  with. I look forward to seeing his full talk at BruCON next weekend.\r\n\r\n"

<p>Over the weekend I attended OWASP AppSec Ireland 2010 at Trinity College in Dublin. The event was a full day event held on the 17th September starting at 9AM and 'officially' ending at 9PM. On my first night in Dublin I went for an excellent Italian meal with some great people, these include <a href="http://www.twitter.com/securityninja" target="_blank">@securityninja</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Angelill0" target="_blank">@Angelill0, </a><a href="http://www.twitter.com/danielcornell" target="_blank">@danielcornell</a> and others.

<p>I wanted to attend the "Smart Phones with Dumb Apps" talk by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danielcornell" target="_blank">@danielcornell</a> as I had a sneak preview of the content the night before at the Italian restaurant. Unfortunately the room was quite packed so I decided to hang out outside with a couple of other people and had some decent conversations.</p>
<p>After a rushed lunch we headed back to see the next keynote talk by Professor Fred Piper from Royal Holloway, University of London. His talk was titled "The changing face of cryptography". This was my favorite talk of the day as Professor Piper talked about cryptography in such a clear and understandable way. If you can catch one of his talks in future I would highly recommend you attend. I would have loved to have heard more of what Professor Piper had to say but it seemed the event was running a little late so he had to cut his talk short.</p>
<p>The last keynote was titled "Hackers and Hollywood: The Implications of the Popular Media Representation of Computer Hacking" by Damian Gordon. He likened his own talk to the funny, light hearted news stories at the end of news broadcasting. His talk was very entertaining and just what I needed after a full day of information overload.</p>
<p>During much of the second half of the day I spent my time with David Robert (<a herf="http://www.twitter.com/castlebbs" target="_blank">@castlebbs</a>). Me and David had exchanged some brief emails regarding his awesome blog <a href="http://blog.ombrepixel.com/" target="_blank">posts</a> about <a href="http://blog.ombrepixel.com/post/2010/08/30/Extending-Burp-Suite-in-Python" target="_blank">extending Burp Suite with Python</a> a few weeks prior to the event. After the event me and Robert headed to the Dandelion pub where we were told we would be invited to a couple of free beers for attending the event. Some people seemed to have vouchers and thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/clerkendweller" target="_blank">@clerkendweller</a> I managed to get my hands on one. I was looking forward to sharing a pint with Mark Hillick (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/markofu" target="_blank">@markofu</a>) however didn't get chance to say much as we were both deep in conversation with other people, fortunately I will be seeing him at BruCON.</p>
<p>I had a great time at the conference, there were some excellent talks and I met some awesome people. Be warned if you do plan to attend in future and are on a limited budget that Dublin was more expensive than I thought. I would have liked to go into more detail about the talks but during my drunken mess I manged to lose my OWASP goody bag which had my notes in. #fail</p>
<p>Thanks to the OWASP Ireland organizers and every who attended for making my stay in Dublin an awesome one.</p>
