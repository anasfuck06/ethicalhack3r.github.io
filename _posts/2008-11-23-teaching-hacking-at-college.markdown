<p>While looking through some old DEFCON material I came across Sam Bowne's video presentation on teaching hacking at college. The presentation was at DEFCON 15 on August 3-5 2007. He speaks about the practicalities of teaching hacking in an academic fashion. Its a must view if your thinking of taking a career path within the security industry and thinking of starting a course in hacking.</p>
