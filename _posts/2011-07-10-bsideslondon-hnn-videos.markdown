<p>20th of April 2011 was the first <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage" target="_blank">BSides</a> held in London, <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/27749044/BSidesLondon" target="_blank">BSidesLondon</a>.</p>
<p>Before the event I had been speaking to Space Rouge of <a href="http://www.hackernews.com/" target="_blank">HNN</a> about <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/hnncast-boxee/" target="_blank">getting HNN content on Boxee</a>. I said I would be attending BSidesLondon and volunteered my time to do some recording for them. This would involve some 'promos', interviews and general conference footage.</p>
<p>I was working at <a href="http://www.infosec.co.uk/" target="_blank">InfoSecurity</a> Europe 2011 on the same day. My boss had kindly allowed me to attend the first half of BSidesLondon as long as I worked the second half of the day at InfoSecurity Europe.</p>
<p>After BSidesLondon I sent my footage to HNN for them to edit into an episode of 'Behind the Firewall'. I asked on a couple of occasions if they had chance to put an episode together out of my footage. The last time I asked, last week, I was told that HNN would be shutting down and that my footage would not be used.</p>
<p>Instead of letting the footage go to waste I thought I would stick the <strong>unedited</strong> interviews on YouTube and share them with you all.</p>

<p>This was my first interview with David Rook (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/securityninja" target="_blank">@securityninja</a>) and Chris Wysopal (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/weldpond" target="_blank">@weldpond</a>) about their talk titled "Jedi mind tricks for building application security programs". I was in two minds whether or not to upload this one. It was my first interview of the day and <strong>ever</strong>. It was a complete failure on my part and is a great example of how <strong>not</strong> to conduct an interview. </p>

<p>My second interview of the day was with one of the organisers of BSidesLondon, Matt Summers (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dive_monkey" target="_blank">@dive_monkey</a>).</p>

<p>My third and last interview of the day was with Justin Clarke (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/connectjunkie" target="_blank">@connectjunkie</a>) about his talk titled "Practical Crypto Attacks Against Web Applications".</p>

<p>Recording for HNN was a pleasure, I failed at interviewing but learnt a lot in the process. Although my interviewing skills sucked, I think the camera did pretty well, it was a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/en-gb/Products/ultra.aspx" target="_blank">Ultra Flip HD</a> with a tripod.</p>
