<p><a href="http://www.randomstorm.com/">RandomStorm</a> have acquired Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) :)</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>RandomStorm showed their interest in DVWA and wanted to help the project grow. After some weeks of talks we have settled on an agreement which I believe will benefit the DVWA project immensely. </p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>What do RandomStorm do?</p>
<blockquote><p>RandomStorm was formed in 2007 to provide a proactive vulnerability management service for companies and organisations that take network security seriously and need to demonstrate maximum due diligence in protecting personal and corporate information.</p></blockquote>

</strong></p>
<p>Without going into too much detail RandomStorm will help develop DVWA further, help with marketing, help with direction and overall make the project as good as it can be. DVWA will now be part of the RandomStorm Open Source Project and will be hosted with them in the near future. I will still play a strong role in the development and general overseeing of the project. The acquirement of DVWA has nothing but positives, the project will still be as great and even greater than it is, I still get to work on my baby, DVWA will still be open source and the project has the backing of a great company, RandomStorm.</p>

<p>Andrew Mason, Chief Technologist at RandomStorm says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see that combining efforts on this will really add value to this great tool and take it to the next step.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>RandomStorm will be releasing an official press release in the near future. I would really like to hear everyones feedback so please comment.</p>
