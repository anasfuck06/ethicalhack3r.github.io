<p>Quite an old story dating back to December 2008, some how I must have missed it. DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) is a standard used for cordless/wireless telephones widely used in homes and businesses across the world. (UK frequency: 1880 MHzâ€“1900 MHz)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A project know as deDECTed.org run by a group of German university students has managed to circumvent DECT's security implementations. Not by cracking the secret DECT Standard Authentication Algorithm (DSAA) but instead they realised that sometimes DECT phones used no encryption or authentication at all when communicating with their base station</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When no encryption is used by a DECT phone the researchers found that with a modified 23euro PCMCIA DECT wireless card they could capture and record all audio data passively using their custom built Linux drivers.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>I have a DECT phone at home as I'm sure most people now a days do. It's quite a scary thought to think that with enough technical knowledge any one can listen to your telephone conversations remotely and passively. I'm sure they would be nothing interesting to be heard on my phone, apart from the occasional take away order, however occasionally I do contact my ISP or bank and provide them with my authentication details to access my accounts.</p>
