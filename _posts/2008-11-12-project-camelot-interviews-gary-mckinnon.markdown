<p>Quite an old video, <span id="duration-and-date"><span class="date">Nov 9, 2007</span></span>. Its interesting to hear Gary's defence straight from the horses mouth. At first when I heard his defence, I thought 'Yea, right! Hes just saying that to try and get a lesser sentence'. After seeing this video he has convinced me that he really was looking for evidence of extraterrestrials and renewable energy. He says that he saw an image of a UFO on one of the NASA machines he hacked and that it was no fake. He used a windows blank administrator password scanner, using remote desktop on a 56k modem. The only remote desktop hacking tools for windows which I'm aware of are TSGrinder and TSCrack, so he must have used one of those.</p>
<p>If your unfamiliar with his case, take a look at <a title="Free Gary" href="http://www.freegary.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.freegary.org.uk</a></p>
<p>Here's the video:</p>
