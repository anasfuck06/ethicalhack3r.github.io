<p>I am tired of receiving multiple telemarketing calls per day, I'm tired of the <a href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/index.html" target="_blank">Telephone Preference Service (TPS)</a> not having an affect and I'm tired of telecommunication companies charging for prevention features which should be free.</p>
<p>I came across an e-petition that was setup by a Rob Whitelock, it is not perfect in its recommendations but certainly puts the general point across.</p>
<blockquote><p>e-petitions is an easy way for you to influence government policy in the UK. You can create an e-petition about anything that the government is responsible for and if it gets at least 100,000 signatures, it will be eligible for debate in the House of Commons.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can help by signing the petition here;<br />
