<p>The war between Israel and Hamas has spilled out onto the Internet. This is no surprise as cyber warfare has been going on for years. The Chinese launched the 'Code Red' worm when an American spy plane collided with one of their fighter jets in 2001 infecting 359,000 hosts in a bid to carry out DDoS attacks on high profile American computers including the white house. Georgia's government websites were the victim of Russian hackers back in August 2008.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>A website set up by a group of Israeli students is actively encouraging users to install software similar to that used by SETI to distribute its data to be processed by idle computers. The website <a title="www.help-israel-win.org" href="http://www.help-israel-win.org" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://66.102.9.104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.help-israel-win.org/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.help-israel-win.org/%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtJO8m56udgWv52UhO60tGZxJkzQ" target="_blank">www.help-israel-win.org</a> is using the same software and technology to use thousands of computer's bandwidth to DDoS Hamas and Hamas supporting websites.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are a group of students who are tired of sitting around doing nothing while the citizens of Sderot and the cities around the Gazza Strip are suffering, NO MORE!<br />
We will not sit around and watch our children fear and cry out for help while the missiles are flying over their heads!<br />
We say NO MORE!</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing this post they claim to have <span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: tahoma; color: black;"><strong>8039</strong> people that have joined them so far. </span>(not sure if this means downloading the software or actually registering and allowing the software to use their computers)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand there are also lots of hackers attacking Israeli websites and networks, this can be seen through out the black hat community forums.</p>
