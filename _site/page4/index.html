        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            Many people including developers, vendors and security professionals believe that Full Path Disclosure (FPD) is mainly a Security Misconfiguration problem rather than a Input Sanitation or Error Handling problem. I'm not saying that they are wrong, but I hope to convince them that it is more of a coding bug than a configuration bug. I want to put my argument over as to why I think FPD is a bug in source code and not in configuration. 

<strong>What is Full Path Disclosure (FPD)?</strong>

According to OWASP:
"Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view."
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure" target="_blank">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure</a>

For me this is a very vague description of what FPD really is. FPD occurs when a web application encounters an error that is displayed to the user; the error includes the full path to the file the error occurred in possibly along with other debugging information.

<strong>Why is it a problem?</strong>

It's just the path of the file from the root directory, what's all the fuss about?

Ayer (o el anterior) Microsoft hizo disponible "Windows 8 Developer Preview" para cualquier persona poder descargar. Yo hize la instalación en <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> siguiendo este <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/RollingIT/archive/2011/09/14/getting-hands-on-with-virtual-machine-of-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank">guía</a> (en Ingles).

Quería ver si Microsoft posiblemente han usado algunas librerías/programas de versiones de Windows antiguos que posiblemente tengan vulnerabilidades remotos y que el <a href="http://metasploit.com/" target="_blank">Metesploit</a> tenga un exploit para el.

Para esto quería usar el db_autopwn para que Metasploit use todos los exploits que tenga para los puertos que Windows 8 Developer tenga abierto. Al mismo ves será un test rápido y sencillo.

            I was playing around with getting <a href="http://www.randomstorm.com/wpscan-security-tool.php" target="_blank">wpscan</a> to run through the <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a> network so I needed to setup Tor (from source) and <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/" target="_blank">Privoxy</a> on <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/" target="_blank">BackTrack</a>. These are the steps I took to setup Tor and Privoxy on Backtrack 5 R1. (wpscan does not yet support scanning through the Tor network)

I am no Tor expert and there are probably easier/better ways of doing this.

<strong>Installing Tor (Anonymous SOCKS proxy):</strong>

<blockquote>
$apt-get install libssl-dev
$wget https://www.torproject.org/dist/tor-0.2.2.32.tar.gz
$tar -xzvf tor-0.2.2.32.tar.gz
$cd tor-0.2.2.32

            20th of April 2011 was the first <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage" target="_blank">BSides</a> held in London, <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/27749044/BSidesLondon" target="_blank">BSidesLondon</a>.

Before the event I had been speaking to Space Rouge of <a href="http://www.hackernews.com/" target="_blank">HNN</a> about <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/hnncast-boxee/" target="_blank">getting HNN content on Boxee</a>. I said I would be attending BSidesLondon and volunteered my time to do some recording for them. This would involve some 'promos', interviews and general conference footage.

I was working at <a href="http://www.infosec.co.uk/" target="_blank">InfoSecurity</a> Europe 2011 on the same day. My boss had kindly allowed me to attend the first half of BSidesLondon as long as I worked the second half of the day at InfoSecurity Europe.

After BSidesLondon I sent my footage to HNN for them to edit into an episode of 'Behind the Firewall'. I asked on a couple of occasions if they had chance to put an episode together out of my footage. The last time I asked, last week, I was told that HNN would be shutting down and that my footage would not be used.

Instead of letting the footage go to waste I thought I would stick the <strong>unedited</strong> interviews on YouTube and share them with you all.

            I assume you have all heard about Lulzsec over the past few months so I will not go into their backstory and instead get straight to the point.

Yesterday, 26th June 2011, they released their last data dump on ThePirateBay (TPB) containing usernames and passwords from a few different sources. One of those sources was hackforums.net, I myself had registered here once upon a time. Luckily I had signed up with a disposable password. It turns out however that, yes, that password was leaked in the final lulzsec data dump.

The data dump has now been removed from TPB due to some of the files allegedly being infected with malware. So I found this site which allows you to search for your email address to see if you may have been effected; <a href="http://dazzlepod.com/lulzsec/final/" target="_blank">http://dazzlepod.com/lulzsec/final/</a>

            After creating the <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/wordpress-brute-force-tool/">WordPress Brute Force Tool</a> last weekend, I decided to create a bigger project out of it, called WPScan. 

WPScan is a black box WordPress Security Scanner written in Ruby which attempts to find known security weaknesses within WordPress installations. Its intended use it to be for security professionals or WordPress administrators to asses the security posture of their WordPress installations. The code base is Open Source and licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPLv3</a>.

<strong>Features include:</strong>

Username enumeration
Weak password cracking (multithreaded)
Version enumeration
Vulnerability enumeration (based on version)
Plugin enumeration <del datetime="2013-01-29T14:40:27+00:00">(todo)</del>

            Following on from my previous post <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/patching-wordpress-username-disclosure/">Patching WordPress Username Disclosure</a> I got bored over the weekend and decided to implement Veronica Valeros's username disclosure technique into a WordPress password brute force tool.

It is nothing revolutionary or difficult to code, but it may come in handy one day on a pentest or web application assessment, mainly to automate the process.

Currently you can use the tool in 3 different ways.

            On May 26th Veronica Valero of Talsoft S.R.L. posted a security advisory on the <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/May/493" target="_blank">Full Disclosure</a> mailing list outlining a username disclosure vulnerability via a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References" target="_blank">Direct Object Reference</a>. 

This is a problem in itself, however, what was more interesting to me was Zerial's <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/May/494" target="_blank">reply</a> to the advisory; 

<blockquote>"Also you can "enumerate" wordpress users using the wp-login.php. Whenyou enter a non-existent user wordpress returns "Invalid username" andwhen you enter a valid user with any random/dummie password, wordpressreturns "Invalid Password". Now you can use brute-force to enumerate allvalid users using, for example, a name&username dictionary."</blockquote>

I often get emails (yes, people actually email me) around September time from young students who have come across this blog wanting to know more about doing Ethical Hacking at university level. I am writing this blog post in part to prevent myself from asking these young people for money for my time in replying to all of their questions. Also there seems to be a lot of misinformation about doing degrees related to computer/information security within the community.

Now, you maybe thinking... Ryan has invested countless thousands of pounds and four years of his life to his Ethical Hacking degree so he is bound to be biased. Well, I guess if I wasn't a little biased then I wouldn't be human, but I am going to try to be as honest as possible.

            So I was listening to the latest PaulDotCom security weekly podcast <a href="http://pauldotcom.com/2011/02/pauldotcom---security-weekly---48.html" target="_blank">episode 232</a> via my <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/securitypodcasts-boxee-app/" target="_blank">SecurityPodcasts Boxee app</a> where Mike Murr or Murray or both?! were talking about effective Phishing and how to be 110% successful.

My phishing experience is minimal so I decided to find out for myself how easy it was to get people to click on 'malicious' hyperlinks. I did this by tweeting the following from my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ethicalhack3r" target="_blank">ethicalhack3r</a> Twitter account.

<a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png"><img src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-02-28 at 11.40.24" width="310" height="125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876" /></a>
"DO NOT CLICK => http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2"

As you can see I tweeted the words "DO NOT CLICK =>" followed by a shortened bit.ly hyperlink. I suspect that most of my (at the time of writing) 3000 followers are in some way interested in information security and are all well aware of the potential risks of clicking unknown shortened hyperlinks. Or so you would think.

            Today I used the following commands to grep through PHP source code to find some bugs. I thought they may be useful to someone else so I thought I would stick them on here. This list is by no means extensive however they are the ones I found most useful. 

<strong>Find user input/output for possible XSS:</strong>

<blockquote>grep -i -r "echo" *
grep -i -r "\$_GET" *
grep -i -r "\$_" * | grep "echo"
grep -i -r "\$_GET" * | grep "echo"
grep -i -r "\$_POST" * | grep "echo"
grep -i -r "\$_REQUEST" * | grep "echo"</blockquote>
