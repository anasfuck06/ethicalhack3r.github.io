  a list of GitHub valid passwords from a few password lists found online and one
  of my own.\r\n\r\nGitHub's password policy is reasonable (at least 7 chars, 1 number
  and 1 letter) so from all of the wordlists used only 331 passwords were found to
  conform to GitHub's password policy.\r\n\r\n"

<p>GitHub was recently the target of a large weak password brute force attack which involved <a href="https://github.com/blog/1698-weak-passwords-brute-forced">40k unique IP addresses</a>. One of many of the security measures GitHub has now taken is to ban users to register with 'commonly-used weak passwords'.</p>
<p>To find out what GitHub considers as 'commonly-used weak passwords' I decided to compile a list of GitHub valid passwords from a few password lists found online and one of my own.</p>
<p>GitHub's password policy is reasonable (at least 7 chars, 1 number and 1 letter) so from all of the wordlists used only 331 passwords were found to conform to GitHub's password policy.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-17208"></a></p>
<p>Out of these 331 passwords GitHub did not allow users to register with the following 21:</p>
<p>Password1<br />
Password123<br />
Qwerty123<br />
a123456<br />
access14<br />
admin123<br />
bond007<br />
letmein1<br />
ncc1701<br />
pa55w0rd<br />
pa55word<br />
passw0rd<br />
password1<br />
password123<br />
princess1<br />
qwerty123<br />
rush2112<br />
summer1<br />
thx1138<br />
trustno1<br />
winter1</p>
<p>This is by no means an extensive list, there are thousands of wordlists online, but it does give some idea of what GitHub considers a 'commonly-used weak password'. I'm sure variations of the above passwords will also be banned, this was not attempted.</p>
