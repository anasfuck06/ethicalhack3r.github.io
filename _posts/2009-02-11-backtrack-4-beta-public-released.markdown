<blockquote>Weve gone live with the beta, and the downloads are going crazy. All our mirrors are at 90 mbit, more or less.</p>
<p>You can get the iso here md5sum and sha512sum</p>
<p>And the VMWare image here md5sum and sha512sum</p>
<p>We are trying to get estimates of downloads. If you link to our ISOs, please use:</p>
<p>http://www.remote-exploit.org/cgi-bin/fileget?version=bt4-beta-iso<br />
http://www.remote-exploit.org/cgi-bin/fileget?version=bt4-beta-vm</p>
<p>and do not link them directly.</p>
<p>Release information will shortly be available on the Remote Exploit Web site.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cant seem to find a change-log as yet, I think it has only been released in the past few hours. It was pre-released at Shmoocon 2009 a couple of weeks ago. I haven't downloaded and tested BT4 however I will definitely be taking a look once I have some spare time. Download it and let us know what you think!</p>
