        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Gary McKinnon's final court date has been pushed back to the 20th January 2009 (the same day Obama takes office).<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Prosecutors say he shut down thousands of machines and caused up to $700,000 worth of damage, while the 42-year-old claims he was searching for evidence of UFOs.</p>
<p>Over the course of the case, defence lawyers argued that McKinnon will face unduly harsh punishment for his actions and should instead face trial in the UK, since the alleged hacking attacks were conducted from a house in north London.</p>
<p>By the time the decision is made, it will be almost seven years since McKinnon ended his activities. During that time a succession of arguments have been made against his removal – including that he faces up to 60 years in prison or detention at Guantánamo Bay, and that he should receive leniency because he suffers from Asperger's syndrome.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Let's start from the top, "$700,000 worth of damage". As far as I'm aware the American government have not produced any evidence to support the amount of damage caused. From what I've read so far Gary broke the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (c.18) point 1, "Unauthorised access to computer material" by logging in to American government, Army, NASA and other American institutions by using a windows null administrator password scanner. He may have broke point 2 of the CMA, "Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences" by using the administrator account to gain further access to other machines or services on the networks. He may also have broke point 3 "Unauthorised modification of computer material", however I'm not aware of the full details. You could argue that he broke point 3 by viewing some of NASA's pictures, as by doing this he was changing the metadata unknowingly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>He broke the Computer Misuse Act on British soil. In my opinion he should be punished in Britain. Ive heard about a new European cyber crime bill being discussed at the moment regarding liability, in short it means that if you leave your network wide open for attack then you are partly liable. However as far as I'm aware this is still being discussed and wouldn't affect Gary's case anyway as it wasn't about when he committed his crimes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Its been 7 years since his crimes were committed and he still hasn't been sentenced. I bet he just wants to get it over and done with by now. If the British government didn't see a problem with extraditing him then why is the process taking so long? There must be some disagreement at a higher level.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>For now we will just have to wait and see what happens on the 20th of Jan and hope that he wins his case to serve his sentence in Britain.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>There's also a demonstration outside the American embassy in London on Friday the 5th of December 2008.</p>

            <blockquote>A COMPUTER expert has been executed in Iran after he confessed to working for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. This provides a rare insight into the intense espionage activity inside the Islamic republic.&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
He was obviously playing a dangerous game and paid for it with his life.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ali Ashtari, 43, a computer and hi-tech equipment buyer for Iran’s defence industry and nuclear programme, was hanged after admitting he worked for Israel. It is the first known conviction of an alleged Israeli agent in Iran for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Ashtari was trusted by senior officials to travel overseas to buy the advanced computers and other electronic equipment needed for the regime’s nuclear programme, which is reported to have already produced enough enriched uranium to make an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Behind their backs he allowed the software he bought to be subtly doctored by Israeli computer engineers before it was imported to Iran. Ashtari confessed: “Mossad’s goal was to sell specialised computer equipment through me to Iranian intelligence organisations.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
You would have thought that Iran would have been more careful as to who they employ and how trustworthy they are. Who knows how many backdoors are still open within Iran's nuclear facility?!</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload designed for post-exploitation tasks.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the steps involved in completely automating exploitation is post-exploitation automation. This is where steps are taken to automate the tasks that are performed after successfully exploiting a target host. The meterpreter implementation in Metasploit 3.0 defines a programmatic interface for the attacker that helps to facilitate this automation, such as by making it easy to interact with processes, networking, and the file system. While all of this has been present for some time, we have only recently added support for Meterpreter scripts. The purpose of meterpreter scripts are to give end-users an easy interface to write quick scripts that can be run against remote targets after successful exploitation. In the long term, we'll make it so that these scripts can run automatically each time a Meterpreter session is created, thus making the post-exploitation process completely automated.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>After playing around with it for a few hours Ive realised that its a very powerful tool for any pen tester to have. I tried in vain to record the exploitation and post exploitation process using the open source screen recorder 'CamStudio' however I was unsuccessfully due to it not recording some of the screen. I will try and find alternative software or have another go with CamStudio in the near future to show you all how powerful the meterpreter payload really is.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Meterpreter has been around since Metasploit version 3 however in the newest version of Metasploit it seems that the meterpreter DLL that gets uploaded to the target machine is no longer detected by anti virus software. In theory Metasploit could scan random IP ranges, exploit targets using autopwn, grab the administrator hashes and then email them to the attacker. A script kiddies wet dream.</p>

            <p>While looking through some old DEFCON material I came across Sam Bowne's video presentation on teaching hacking at college. The presentation was at DEFCON 15 on August 3-5 2007. He speaks about the practicalities of teaching hacking in an academic fashion. Its a must view if your thinking of taking a career path within the security industry and thinking of starting a course in hacking.</p>

<p>This would be an excellent way to raise awareness of Gary's case and hopefully encourage a debate regarding the UK/US extradition treaty.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Hemsworth, who is also UK director of the International UFO Congress, plans to organise a ‘Band Aid style' song recorded at Abbey Road studios and hopes George Michael will sing Mr McKinnon's own single, Only a Fool.

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>The new Metasploit Framework was released on the 19th November (yesterday). It has a massive change log with lots of tweaks and add ons. I will try and list the interesting ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Version 3.2 includes exploit modules for recent Microsoft flaws, such<br />
as MS08-041, MS08-053, MS08-059, MS08-067, MS08-068, and many more.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I may have to test my Windows 2000 box again and see if any of the above work.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Windows payload stagers have been updated to support targets with<br />
NX CPU support. These stagers now allocate a read/write/exec segment of<br />
memory for all payload downloads and execution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Staggered payloads are the only ones I could get working against Windows 2000.</p>
<blockquote><p>This release includes a set of man-in-the-middle, authentication relay,<br />
and authentication capture modules. These modules can be integrated with<br />
a fake proxy (WPAD), a malicious access point (Karmetasploit), or basic<br />
network traffic interception to gain access to client machines. These<br />
modules tie together browser_autopwn, SMB relaying, and HTTP credential<br />
and form capturing to pillage data from client systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Metasploit can now sniff traffic too!</p>
<blockquote><p>Egypt's new PHP payloads provide complete bind, reverse, and findsock<br />
support for PHP web application exploits. If you are sick of C99 and R57<br />
and looking to gain a "real" shell from one of the hundreds of RFI flaws<br />
listed on milw0rm, the new PHP payloads work great against multiple<br />
operating systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will have to have play with this one!</p>
<blockquote><p>The db_autopwn command has been revamped to support port-based limits,<br />
regex-based module matching, and limits on the number of spawned jobs. The<br />
end result is a way to quickly launch specific modules against a specific<br />
set of target machines. These changes were suggested and implemented by<br />
Marcell 'SkyOut' Dietl (Helith).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the feature used by Fast|Track, doesn't mention an OS limitation, that would be the next logical step.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            A couple of weeks ago I was going to test Fast|Track against a Windows 98 machine however I couldn't get my wireless card to work on it and I couldn't be arsed moving the PC out of the spare room. I finally got Windows 2000 with no patches or updates up and running. I installed Windows 2000 as according to many its very vulnerable.

Fast|Track is an automated tool that comes pre installed in BackTrack. It scans an ip address or range for open ports using NMap, once it has scanned the machine(s) it trys every exploit for the open ports found using NMap's autopwn feature via Metasploit. It doesn't take any notice of NMap's OS discovery, so even if NMap discovers that the machine is running Windows 2000 with 100% accuracy (it didn't), it will still try other OS exploits.

After Fast|Track had finished scanning and exploiting It gave me 4 active shell sessions that it had spawned from successful exploits.

            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>nUbuntu is an Ubuntu live CD with all the desktop packages removed, like gnome, evolution, open office and most other packages which come installed in Ubuntu by default. It comes with many security packages pre installed and ready to use. It could be compared to other security live Cd's like BackTrack or Auditor.</p>
<p><strong>Where to get it?</strong></p>
<p><a title="nubuntu download" href="http://www.nubuntu.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">http://www.nubuntu.org/downloads.php</a></p>
<p><strong>How do you install it?</strong></p>
<p>You can download the ISO image file, burn it to CD and boot it. What I chose to do was download the ISO image file and make a virtual machine image, so I could run it straight from my desktop as I do with BackTrack.</p>
<p>Here's a guide on how to create a virtual machine from an ISO image file using VMWare:</p>
<p><a title="creat vmware from iso" href="http://www.howtoforge.com/create-vmware-machines-from-iso-files-without-burning-cds-dvds" target="_blank">http://www.howtoforge.com/create-vmware-machines-from-iso-files-without-burning-cds-dvds</a></p>
<p><strong>What do I think?</strong></p>
<p>It works well, had no problems while booting. I like the fact that all the fancy Ubuntu stuff has been taken out. As for the pre installed scripts and tools (which is what were most interested in), It doesnt have as many tools pre installed as BackTrack does, however it does have some tools which BackTrack doesn't have. A couple of examples would be Wapiti, Nessus and Onesixtyone. It also has an option to install to HDD which BackTrack doesn't have, but the point of a live CD is to boot from the CD, its always nice to have the option tho. I like the fact that BackTrack has FTP, VNC and other server software pre installed, nUbuntu doesnt.  All in all  I think i will be sticking with BackTrack for now, however I will be keeping a close eye on this one.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know! Download it and let me know!</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>I was on my way to work some time last year when I saw an ATM with a DOS prompt on the screen. So I went over to have a look and took some pics on my mobile phone. The pictures I took revealed that the ATM was running Windows 95. Yes, you read right, Windows 95!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dsc00098.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24" title="dsc00098" src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dsc00098-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>According to Secunia:</p>
<p>Windows 95 has 7 advisories with 3 of them unpatched. (As Microsoft doesn't support Windows 95 anymore they will never be patched.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Solution Status" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=sol&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Criticality" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=cri&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Where" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=fro&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Impact" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=imp&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="300" /></p>
<p>As you can see Windows 95 is not a very safe OS to run, never mind on an ATM! Lets summarise the graphs above. 50% unpatched, 75% remotely and 50% system access.</p>
<p>So the question is, how safe is your money? Not very by the looks of it.</p>

            <p>Quite an old video, <span id="duration-and-date"><span class="date">Nov 9, 2007</span></span>. Its interesting to hear Gary's defence straight from the horses mouth. At first when I heard his defence, I thought 'Yea, right! Hes just saying that to try and get a lesser sentence'. After seeing this video he has convinced me that he really was looking for evidence of extraterrestrials and renewable energy. He says that he saw an image of a UFO on one of the NASA machines he hacked and that it was no fake. He used a windows blank administrator password scanner, using remote desktop on a 56k modem. The only remote desktop hacking tools for windows which I'm aware of are TSGrinder and TSCrack, so he must have used one of those.</p>
<p>If your unfamiliar with his case, take a look at <a title="Free Gary" href="http://www.freegary.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.freegary.org.uk</a></p>
<p>Here's the video:</p>
