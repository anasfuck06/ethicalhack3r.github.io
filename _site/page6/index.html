        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            DevBUG is an idea that came to me while conducting a Vulnerability Assessment for University a few months back. We did a service scan on a web server and found that way too many ports and services were running! But that wasn't the problem, well, not for us anyway. The problem was, is that we had 20 different software services and versions to google and write about.

So what is the process? We needed to find the software package's homepage, find what the latest version of the package is for the development tree that was used, find out how old the version the web server was running was and then try to find any known vulnerabilities associated with that version. This is not too much hassle when you have to do it one to three times however when you have to do it twenty to fifty times it starts to become time consuming.

So in comes DevBUG. DevBUG is a web application which will be free for any one to use, no subscriptions or anything. It will be a search engine for software packages and their versions. Three times a day (every 8 hours) starting at 8AM GMT a backed spider will visit every software package's homepage looking for new versions, if it finds a new version this will be added to a database. So the idea is, to keep a record of software, their released versions, release dates and any vulnerabilities which may affect each version. So this is great to solve our original problem! We have a one stop shop for all the information we need! But what other uses does it have?

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            In the Information Security industry it is said that if you have security clearance you can earn significantly more income and work on exiting secret projects for government agencies. So what is security clearance and how do I get it?

Security clearance is a way to prove your trustworthiness at a particular point in time so that you can work with sensitive information on government projects. Your trustworthiness is assessed by a thorough background check. There are a number of different security clearance levels depending on the sensitivity of the information which you are required to work with. These levels were changed in the UK during WWII to reflect those of the US so that sensitive information could be shared and the sensitivity of the information not be confused.

<strong>National Security Clearances:</strong>

<blockquote><strong>Developed Vetting (DV) </strong>
This is the highest level of Security Clearance and is required for people with substantial unsupervised access to TOP SECRET assets, or for working in the intelligence or security agencies. This level of clearance involves Security Check (SC) and, in addition, completion of a (DV) questionnaire, financial checks, checking of references and a detailed interview with a vetting officer. To gain (DV) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 10 years.
 
<strong>Security Check (SC)</strong> is for people who have substantial access to SECRET, or occasional access to TOP SECRET assets and information. This level of clearance involves a (BPSS) check plus UK criminal and security checks and a credit check. To gain (SC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 5 years.

<strong>Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)</strong> is required for personnel whose work involves close proximity to public figures, gives access to information or material vulnerable to terrorist attack or involves unrestricted access to certain government or commercial establishments. A (CTC) does not allow access, or knowledge, or custody, of protectively marked assets and information. The check includes a Baseline Personnel Security Standard Check (BPSS) and also a check against national security records. To gain (CTC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 3 years.

<strong>Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</strong> (formally Basic Check)and Enhanced Baseline Standard (EBS) (formerly Enhanced Basic Check or Basic Check +): These are not formal security clearances; they are a package of pre-employment checks that represent good recruitment and employment practice.
A BPSS or EBS aims to provide an appropriate level of assurance as to the trustworthiness, integrity, and probable reliability of prospective employees.  The check is carried out by screening identity documents and references.</blockquote>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            In 2007 the <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/">Hardened-PHP Project</a> setup by three German Security Researchers organised the Month of PHP Bugs (MOPB). The 'Month of Bugs' concept was started by non other than HD Moore back in 2006 with his Month of Browser Bugs (MoBB) which found security holes within most of the popular browsers. Since then there have been many 'Month's of Bugs' including <a href="http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/">Month of Kernel Bugs (MoKB)</a>, <a href="http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/">Month of Apple Bugs</a>, <a href="http://twitpwn.com/">Month of Twitter Bugs</a> and the <a href="http://theharmonyguy.com/2009/09/15/the-month-of-facebook-bugs-halfway-report/">Month of Facebook Bugs</a>.

<strong>So why a Month of Bugs?</strong>
"The intention of the Month of PHP Security is to gather the best research and articles about PHP security topics from the security community and share them with the rest of the world. This time the goal is not only to improve the security of PHP itself and applications directly by fixing security bugs, but also to help PHP developers around the world to write better and more secure PHP applications."

            It is very easy for some one to find an XSS vulnerability within a web application and write a report about it. According to <a href="http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/assets/WPStatsreport_100107.pdf">WhiteHat Security</a> (2007) there is a 73% chance that you will find an XSS vulnerability within a web application. Does finding one of these mean you have assessed the security of the web application? Let's take a web application vulnerability that is 'seen' to be more critical. Again, according to <a href="http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/assets/WPStatsreport_100107.pdf">WhiteHat Security</a> you have a 18% likelihood to find an SQL Injection vulnerability within a web application. So during the web application security assessment you have found an SQL injection vulnerability, the back end DBMS is a version of Microsoft SQL Server which has '<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175046.aspx">xp_cmdshell</a>' enabled by default. You manage to get a reverse shell and acquire a copy of the database. Great! By gaining shell access to the server does that mean you have properly assessed the security of the web application? No!

            Report writing has a bad reputation, every one seems to hate writing them and believe it to be the anticlimax of the assessment process. I haven't been writing reports for very long, the reports that I have written I have enjoyed, no doubt in time the novelty will wear off and I will grow to hate them too. There are however lessons that I have learnt in my short report writing experience which I believe could have made my report writing that little bit easier and less time consuming. Those lessons I am going to share with you and if your just starting out in your report writing duties hopefully these can help you too. Or if your a report writing guru share your tips with me! The reports I have written are mainly web application assessments so I will concentrate on those.

You who know me will know that I my self am enrolled on one of these University courses. I believe that if you're starting out in security and want to make a career out of it this may be the best place to start. For me the course has done wonders, not only in what I have learnt however the people I've met and the drive it has given me to succeed in my chosen career.

            After running Glastopf (<a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/2010/01/10/glastopf-web-application-honeypot/">Glastopf – Web Application Honeypot</a>) for a few days and not getting any hits, I was a bit disappointed. I speculate that maybe you need to give web application honeypots more time to propagate across the Internet and get picked up by search engines to receive any significant hits, or even give the honeypot its own domain name. From my earlier post you will notice that I had tried to get Dionaea to run first.

Markus the lead developer of Dionaea got in contact after he read my post and saw that I was having trouble getting it running. It turned out to be a complete fail on my part, after following the instructions on the Dionaea <a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/">homepage</a>, Dionaea installed perfectly fine, it was just a case of me not knowing how to run it properly.

<strong>What is Dionaea?</strong>
<blockquote>Dionaea is meant to be a nepenthes successor, embedding python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting ipv6 and tls</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dionaea intention is to trap malware exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by services offerd to a network, the ultimate goal is gaining a copy of the malware.</blockquote>

I bought an old battered PC over the weekend with the goal of installing a honeypot. I had never installed a honeypot before so wasn't quite sure what to expect. At first I decided on <a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/" target="_blank">Dionaea</a> the succsesor to Nepenthes, I had heard great things about Nepenthes from a friend of mine (<a href="http://infosanity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Infosanity</a>). After going through the installation process, I couldn't get Dionaea to 'make' with the right Python version detected (> 3.0), after about an hour of playing around I decided to give <a href="http://glastopf.org/" target="_blank">Glastopf</a> a try.

            I had a security breach on the blog over the Christmas period. To cut a long story short two black hats named HcJ and cyb3r-1st compromised another site on the shared hosting server, they decided to deface my blogs for a short period of time while they were at it. After talking to both of them regarding the breach it turns out they are nice guys (a bit misguided), they told me how they breached the server so that I could pass the information on to the hosting provider for them to patch it.

            <a href="http://www.randomstorm.com/">RandomStorm</a> have acquired Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) :)

<strong>
</strong>

RandomStorm showed their interest in DVWA and wanted to help the project grow. After some weeks of talks we have settled on an agreement which I believe will benefit the DVWA project immensely. 

<strong>
</strong>

What do RandomStorm do?

<blockquote>RandomStorm was formed in 2007 to provide a proactive vulnerability management service for companies and organisations that take network security seriously and need to demonstrate maximum due diligence in protecting personal and corporate information.</blockquote>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            I started a poll last week on the 1st of December tittled 'Open Source Web Application Vulnerability Scanners'. The aim of this poll was to gain feedback from as many people in the security community as possible to find out which was their preferred open source web application vulnerability scanner, what they preferred about it and what they would improve about their favorite scanner. The poll has run for almost 7 days. The poll link was posted on Twitter (via my Twitter account), on this blog and on <a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/" target="_blank">www.ethicalhacker.net</a>.

<strong>
</strong>

The total number of submissions was 32 however there were some anomalies in the data mainly due to my own fault. I had originally included Burp Suite, I had confused their free version with it being open source, it turns out this is not the case. I also had submissions from application developers, I did not state that I wouldn't be counting their votes however I believe it fairer if we didn't. After taking out the votes for Burp Suite (3 before removing the option), the submissions from application developers (2) and submissions for other commercial scanners (2), it left us with a total of 25 submissions.
