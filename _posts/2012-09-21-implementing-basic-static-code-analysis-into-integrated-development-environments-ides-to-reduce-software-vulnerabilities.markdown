<p>This is the paper that I submitted for my undergraduate dissertation in Ethical Hacking for Computer Security. The title (a mouth full) 'Implementing Basic Static Code Analysis into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to Reduce Software Vulnerabilities'. The paper talks about software security, modern software development, software development life cycles, static code analysis and a lot more. Since submitting it I have noticed some mistakes so I'm not putting this out there as a 'perfect paper'.</p>
<p>The paper was the research and implementation of <a href="http://www.devbug.co.uk" target="_blank">DevBug</a> an online PHP Static Code Analysis tool written mostly in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a read through, I won't be making any future amendments as I was sick of looking at it by the time I submitted it but I thought I would put it out there incase it was useful to others in learning about software security. It is a bit dry in places, be warned!</p>
