<p>In order to know where weâ€™re going, we have to understand where we have come from.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I had the idea of creating the Web Application Security Timeline (WAST) and posted an RFC yesterday in this post: <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/web-application-security-timeline-rfc/">http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/web-application-security-timeline-rfc/</a>. After much feedback from the WebAppSec community from various mailing lists, Twitter, email and this blog I present to you version 1.0!</p>
<blockquote><p>"This timeline was created by Ryan Dewhurst from the accumulation of feedback from the WebAppSec community to visualise and allow others to visualise the significant events in the short history of web application security. This image holds no copyright or has any restrictions of use, think of this image as yours and do as you wish with it. If you believe that any of the information on the timeline is incorrect or have any other feedback on improvements please email ryandewhurst-A-gmail.com with the subject of 'wast'."</p></blockquote>
