            Following on from my previous post <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/patching-wordpress-username-disclosure/">Patching WordPress Username Disclosure</a> I got bored over the weekend and decided to implement Veronica Valeros's username disclosure technique into a WordPress password brute force tool.

It is nothing revolutionary or difficult to code, but it may come in handy one day on a pentest or web application assessment, mainly to automate the process.

Currently you can use the tool in 3 different ways.

            On May 26th Veronica Valero of Talsoft S.R.L. posted a security advisory on the <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/May/493" target="_blank">Full Disclosure</a> mailing list outlining a username disclosure vulnerability via a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References" target="_blank">Direct Object Reference</a>. 

This is a problem in itself, however, what was more interesting to me was Zerial's <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/May/494" target="_blank">reply</a> to the advisory; 

<blockquote>"Also you can "enumerate" wordpress users using the wp-login.php. Whenyou enter a non-existent user wordpress returns "Invalid username" andwhen you enter a valid user with any random/dummie password, wordpressreturns "Invalid Password". Now you can use brute-force to enumerate allvalid users using, for example, a name&username dictionary."</blockquote>

I often get emails (yes, people actually email me) around September time from young students who have come across this blog wanting to know more about doing Ethical Hacking at university level. I am writing this blog post in part to prevent myself from asking these young people for money for my time in replying to all of their questions. Also there seems to be a lot of misinformation about doing degrees related to computer/information security within the community.

Now, you maybe thinking... Ryan has invested countless thousands of pounds and four years of his life to his Ethical Hacking degree so he is bound to be biased. Well, I guess if I wasn't a little biased then I wouldn't be human, but I am going to try to be as honest as possible.

            So I was listening to the latest PaulDotCom security weekly podcast <a href="http://pauldotcom.com/2011/02/pauldotcom---security-weekly---48.html" target="_blank">episode 232</a> via my <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/securitypodcasts-boxee-app/" target="_blank">SecurityPodcasts Boxee app</a> where Mike Murr or Murray or both?! were talking about effective Phishing and how to be 110% successful.

My phishing experience is minimal so I decided to find out for myself how easy it was to get people to click on 'malicious' hyperlinks. I did this by tweeting the following from my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ethicalhack3r" target="_blank">ethicalhack3r</a> Twitter account.

<a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png"><img src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-02-28 at 11.40.24" width="310" height="125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876" /></a>
"DO NOT CLICK => http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2"

As you can see I tweeted the words "DO NOT CLICK =>" followed by a shortened bit.ly hyperlink. I suspect that most of my (at the time of writing) 3000 followers are in some way interested in information security and are all well aware of the potential risks of clicking unknown shortened hyperlinks. Or so you would think.

            Over the weekend I attended OWASP AppSec Ireland 2010 at Trinity College in Dublin. The event was a full day event held on the 17th September starting at 9AM and 'officially' ending at 9PM. On my first night in Dublin I went for an excellent Italian meal with some great people, these include <a href="http://www.twitter.com/securityninja" target="_blank">@securityninja</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Angelill0" target="_blank">@Angelill0, </a><a href="http://www.twitter.com/danielcornell" target="_blank">@danielcornell</a> and others. The evening was polished off with a traditional pint of Guiness in a local pub.

On the day of the conference I arrived a little early and had some brief discussions with a couple of the attendees. The conference kicked off with the keynote talk by John Viega titled "Application Security in the Real World". This was an excellent talk that put into perspective the reality of application security within business. The keynote was followed by a brief unplanned summary by Samy Kamkar on his talk which he is touring Europe with. I look forward to seeing his full talk at BruCON next weekend.

Dropbox has become very popular and widely used as it has so many different uses and makes file sharing over the internet easy. Dropbox allows you to make public image galleries, share files publicly, share files between computers and manage version control. All this straight from your file system. I like to think of it as git or a subversion repository with a nice interface.

            It's not often I interview people for the blog however when some one catches my eye and raises my interest I like to find out more about them and share it with my readers. This time I interviewed 'The Jester'. The Jester has been in the media spotlight recently for taking down Jihadist terrorist web sites via use of a targeted DoS attacks. 

<strong>* Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do?</strong>

Ryan, I would like to give you and your readers a little more about me but it's kind of difficult to do that, given the nature of my targets, all I can give you sir is what's already 'out there' - I am ex-mil - and slightly pissed at the surge in Jihadist online activities.

Now with regard to what I do: I aim to cause disruption to the online efforts of Jihadists on the internet. They have realized that they can recruit, train and coordinate home-grown terrorists completely via the internet, without ever having to meet. This cuts out much of the risk associated with any face-to-face contact for the recruiters. Web recruitment targets young, tech-savvy, vulnerable Muslims, the iPod generation if you like. By making these sites unreliable, the potential recruit numbers start to dwindle. I limit my hits to defined time-slots (rather than killing them completely) because I am well aware that official Counter Terrorist Agencies use some of these sites for intelligence gathering. I have been asked why I DON'T hit certain sites, well it's simple. By NOT hitting certain sites (and hitting others hard) I am 'herding', people give up easily when a site is constantly up and down, and move on to a more reliable one. So it creates a funnel-effect, funneling terrorists and potential terrorists away from peripheral sites and into a smaller space that is easier to monitor.

            A white paper released recently (not dated) by the University of California titled ‘Why Johnny Can’t Pentest: An Analysis of Black-box Web Vulnerability Scanners’ evaluates eleven commercial and open-source black-box web vulnerability scanners.

The three authors of the paper (Adoupe, Marco, Vigna) test the black-box scanners against their custom vulnerable web application they called WackoPicko. Their custom web application contained a number of different technical and business logic vulnerabilities, both authenticated and un-authenticated. 

They tested each scanner against WackoPicko in three different modes. Initial (point-and-click), Config (login credentials/mechanism provided) and Manual (local proxy use). The eleven scanners tested were Acunetix, Appscan, Burp, Grendel-Scan, Hailstorm, Milescan, N-Stalker, NTOSpider, Paros, w3af and Webinspect.
