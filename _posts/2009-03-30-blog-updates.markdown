<p>Just to let everyone know that we are now running the latest version of wordpress, finally! If you haven't noticed already there's a 'Security Jobs' RSS feed which grabs RSS feeds off a number of job sites, the link can be found in the sidebar above the google ads.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
Ive fixed the footer as it was out of line and also made the pagination a little bit nicer however during the process of updating the site I seem to have messed up the 'pages', the ones in the green bar at the top. Haven't a clue whats gone wrong, spent the past few hours staring at CSS, PHP and HTML and still cannot figure out what I have done!!! I'm going to leave it for now and come back to it another day.<br />

Some exiting news...</p>
<p>Me and some other lads from university have started a project called 'ScreenStamp!' I will be posting about it shortly.</p>
