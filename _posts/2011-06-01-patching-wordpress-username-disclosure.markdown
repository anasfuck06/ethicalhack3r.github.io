<p>As we can see from a simple test on <a href="https://wordpress.org/wp-login.php" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/wp-login.php</a>, what he was saying was true.</p>
<p>Existent user 'admin':<br />
<img src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-01-at-14.54.58.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-06-01 at 14.54.58" width="408" height="433" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16037" /></p>
<p>Non-Existent user 'nonexistant':<br />

<p>As we can see from the two screenshots above, there is a clear difference in the error message that is displayed by WordPress when a user exists or does not. According to OSVDB <a href="http://osvdb.org/55713" target="_blank">55713</a> this vulnerability was reported to WordPress by Core Security Technologies in June 2009. At the time of writing, the latest version of WordPress is 3.1.3 and is still vulnerable to this vulnerability. </p>
<p>Here is how to patch the vulnerability highlighted by 'Zerial' yourself:</p>
<p><strong>wp-includes/user.php:91</strong></p>
<p>Change:</p>
<p>
{% highlight php %}
return new WP_Error('invalid_username', sprintf(__('ERROR: Invalid username. <a href="%s" title="Password Lost and Found">Lost your password< /a>?'), site_url('wp-login.php?action=lostpassword', 'login')));</a>
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>{% highlight php %}
return new WP_Error( 'invalid_username', sprintf( __( 'ERROR: Invalid username and/or password.')));
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p><strong>wp-includes/user.php:111</strong></p>
<p>Change:</p>
<p>{% highlight php %}
return new WP_Error( 'incorrect_password', sprintf( __( 'ERROR: The password you entered for the username <strong>%1$s</strong> is incorrect.      <a href="%2$s" title="Password Lost and Found">Lost your password</a>?' )
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>{% highlight php %}
  return new WP_Error( 'incorrect_password', sprintf( __( 'ERROR: Invalid username and/or password.')));
  {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Let's hope WordPress patch this and the one Veronica disclosed sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>After some further searching it seems a bug report was issued in 2007 on WordPress's Trac. <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3708" target="_blank">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3708</a></p>
<blockquote><p>"There are other ways to verify user names. You can reverse engineer them from the author archive URLs (e.g.  http://example.com/author/mark/). I believe the consensus last time this came up was that it was trivial to figure out the user names anyway, and that it is much more user-friendly to tell them when they messed up their username, and not the password. Also, "admin" is created on install, and can't be changed using WordPress itself, so there's no hiding that."</p></blockquote>
