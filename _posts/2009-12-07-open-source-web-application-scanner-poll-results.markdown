excerpt: "I started a poll last week on the 1st of December tittled 'Open Source Web
  Application Vulnerability Scanners'. The aim of this poll was to gain feedback from
  as many people in the security community as possible to find out which was their
  preferred open source web application vulnerability scanner, what they preferred
  about it and what they would improve about their favorite scanner. The poll has
  run for almost 7 days. The poll link was posted on Twitter (via my Twitter account),
  on this blog and on <a href=\"http://www.ethicalhacker.net/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ethicalhacker.net</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  total number of submissions was 32 however there were some anomalies in the data
  mainly due to my own fault. I had originally included Burp Suite, I had confused
  their free version with it being open source, it turns out this is not the case.
  I also had submissions from application developers, I did not state that I wouldn't
  be counting their votes however I believe it fairer if we didn't. After taking out
  the votes for Burp Suite (3 before removing the option), the submissions from application
  developers (2) and submissions for other commercial scanners (2), it left us with
  a total of 25 submissions.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n"

<p>As you can see from the results w3af is the clear favorite open source web application vulnerability scanner of the people who made submissions with the Metasploit Framework coming a close second. Judging from some of the additional comments, I believe that some people were voting for the Metasploit Framework itself rather than the web application modules it includes. The two biggest improvements the community want in w3af is stability and less false positives.</p>
