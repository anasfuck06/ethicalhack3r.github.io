<p>Here is one of the vulnerabilities which I found during my research for <a title="Bonsai Security" href="http://www.bonsai-sec.com" target="_blank">Bonsai Security</a> a few weeks ago. The research consisted of vulnerability assessing commercial and open source ecommerce web applications over a 2 week period.</p>
<p>During the time of my research I learnt a great deal from Andres Riancho (<a title="w3af" href="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">w3af</a>/bonsai-sec owner) and from the vulnerability assessments them selves. So what did I learn? I learnt that patience is definitely a virtue, javascript is a pain in the ass, ecommerce web application developers need to invest more time on security and a lot more as regards to perfecting my assessment techniques.</p>
<p>Here is the vulnerability report:</p>

<p>Here is a great post by Andres on the difficulty on the actual exploitation:</p>

<p>A massive thanks to Andres for giving me the opportunity to work for him. I learnt more in the (just over) two week period working for him than I could have learnt in a whole 12 months.</p>
