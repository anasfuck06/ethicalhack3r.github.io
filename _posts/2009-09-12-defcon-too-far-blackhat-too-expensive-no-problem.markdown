<p>Have no fear SecurityTubeCon is here! (well... soon!)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>SecurityTubeCon is the first hacker conference to be held completely in cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>SecurityTubeCon is aimed at democratizing hacker conferences by allowing any researcher, regardless of his physical location, to share his work with the community. Unlike other Cons we will not *accept / reject* speakers. If you have something interesting to share, you WILL be heard. The idea behind SecurityTubeCon is not to pass judgments on your work, instead, it aims at providing a platform for knowledge exchange.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ive always wanted to attend a hacker conference however for a poor student like me its not easy. If you don't live in a big city you have to get to the conference by plane or train (£100 to £500), buy a ticket to attend (£50 to £1000), pay for a hotel (£100 - £300) and then pay for food/beer (£50 - £150), not to mention the time off work. All in all it can be an expensive trip!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>SecurityTubeCon will be held on the 6th, 7th and and 8th of November. Location: cyberspace</p>
