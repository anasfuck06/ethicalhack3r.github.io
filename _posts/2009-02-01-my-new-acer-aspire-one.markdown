<p>Just bought an Acer Aspire One! It cost me £150 from ASDA (instore only), here are the specs:</p>
<p>OS: Linpus Lite (Linux)</p>
<p>RAM: 512MB</p>
<p>HDD: IDE 1.8" 160GB</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Atom N270  											1.6 GHz</p>
<p>Display: 8.9" 1024x600</p>

<p>The keyboard is not too small, it has a normal sized UK enter button, screen size is fine and its very light. You can buy a 1GB RAM stick that only costs £10 from crucial however to fit it you have to pull the whole machine apart. Why didnt they just install a flap at the base of the machine for easy access? God knows! I havent upgraded the RAM yet however I am considering it. The default user interface is designed for babies however migrating to the 'advanced' mode and the XFCE desktop was only a few clicks away. Linpus Lite comes with the XFCE desktop enviroment which I think is fine, I may change to another Linux distro in the future.</p>
