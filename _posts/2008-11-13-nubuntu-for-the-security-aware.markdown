<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>nUbuntu is an Ubuntu live CD with all the desktop packages removed, like gnome, evolution, open office and most other packages which come installed in Ubuntu by default. It comes with many security packages pre installed and ready to use. It could be compared to other security live Cd's like BackTrack or Auditor.</p>
<p><strong>Where to get it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you install it?</strong></p>
<p>You can download the ISO image file, burn it to CD and boot it. What I chose to do was download the ISO image file and make a virtual machine image, so I could run it straight from my desktop as I do with BackTrack.</p>
<p>Here's a guide on how to create a virtual machine from an ISO image file using VMWare:</p>

<p><strong>What do I think?</strong></p>
<p>It works well, had no problems while booting. I like the fact that all the fancy Ubuntu stuff has been taken out. As for the pre installed scripts and tools (which is what were most interested in), It doesnt have as many tools pre installed as BackTrack does, however it does have some tools which BackTrack doesn't have. A couple of examples would be Wapiti, Nessus and Onesixtyone. It also has an option to install to HDD which BackTrack doesn't have, but the point of a live CD is to boot from the CD, its always nice to have the option tho. I like the fact that BackTrack has FTP, VNC and other server software pre installed, nUbuntu doesnt.  All in all  I think i will be sticking with BackTrack for now, however I will be keeping a close eye on this one.</p>
