<p>I was on my way to work some time last year when I saw an ATM with a DOS prompt on the screen. So I went over to have a look and took some pics on my mobile phone. The pictures I took revealed that the ATM was running Windows 95. Yes, you read right, Windows 95!!!</p>

<p>According to Secunia:</p>
<p>Windows 95 has 7 advisories with 3 of them unpatched. (As Microsoft doesn't support Windows 95 anymore they will never be patched.)</p>

<p>As you can see Windows 95 is not a very safe OS to run, never mind on an ATM! Lets summarise the graphs above. 50% unpatched, 75% remotely and 50% system access.</p>
<p>So the question is, how safe is your money? Not very by the looks of it.</p>
