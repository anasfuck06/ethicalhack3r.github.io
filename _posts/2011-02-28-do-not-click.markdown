  target=\"_blank\">SecurityPodcasts Boxee app</a> where Mike Murr or Murray or both?!
  were talking about effective Phishing and how to be 110% successful.\r\n\r\nMy phishing
  experience is minimal so I decided to find out for myself how easy it was to get
  people to click on 'malicious' hyperlinks. I did this by tweeting the following
  from my <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ethicalhack3r\" target=\"_blank\">ethicalhack3r</a>
  Twitter account.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png\"><img

  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-876\" /></a>\r\n\"DO NOT CLICK => http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2\"\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see I tweeted the words \"DO NOT CLICK =>\" followed by a shortened bit.ly
  hyperlink. I suspect that most of my (at the time of writing) 3000 followers are
  in some way interested in information security and are all well aware of the potential
  risks of clicking unknown shortened hyperlinks. Or so you would think.\r\n\r\n"

<p>So I was listening to the latest PaulDotCom security weekly podcast <a href="http://pauldotcom.com/2011/02/pauldotcom---security-weekly---48.html" target="_blank">episode 232</a> via my <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/securitypodcasts-boxee-app/" target="_blank">SecurityPodcasts Boxee app</a> where Mike Murr or Murray or both?! were talking about effective Phishing and how to be 110% successful.</p>
<p>My phishing experience is minimal so I decided to find out for myself how easy it was to get people to click on 'malicious' hyperlinks. I did this by tweeting the following from my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ethicalhack3r" target="_blank">ethicalhack3r</a> Twitter account.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png"><img src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-28-at-11.40.24.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-02-28 at 11.40.24" width="310" height="125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876" /></a><br />
"DO NOT CLICK => http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2"</p>
<p>As you can see I tweeted the words "DO NOT CLICK =>" followed by a shortened bit.ly hyperlink. I suspect that most of my (at the time of writing) 3000 followers are in some way interested in information security and are all well aware of the potential risks of clicking unknown shortened hyperlinks. Or so you would think.</p>

<p>The http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2 hyperlink leads to <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/spam/spam.html" target="_blank">http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/spam/spam.html</a> which if your too afraid to click on looks like this. (there is no reason not to click on the aforementioned link... I swear... no really...)</p>

<p>Want to know how many people actually clicked on that 'malicious' shortened bit.ly hyperlink? At the time of writing the link was clicked 183 times and retweeted 8 times. Wow! 183 clicks! Not forgetting the type of people I suspect follow me, I tweeted on a Sunday night and just the once. To see the stats for yourself: <a href="http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2+" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/eIC1Y2+</a></p>
<p>Now I suspect most of my followers clicked the link because they knew that I would never really post malicious content as I have never done so before. However even if this is the case, who's to say that my Twitter account wasn't compromised and a real malicious user was actually trying to compromise my followers?! I suspect some clicked out of sheer curiosity, finding out what is behind that link is more valuable to them than actually getting owned. </p>
<p>There are a couple of ways of protecting yourself from this type of attack:</p>
<p>Keep your software up to date! - <a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/online/" target="_blank">http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/online/</a></p>
<p>Do not click on untrusted hyperlinks no matter who they are from.</p>
