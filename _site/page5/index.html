            Today I used the following commands to grep through PHP source code to find some bugs. I thought they may be useful to someone else so I thought I would stick them on here. This list is by no means extensive however they are the ones I found most useful.

            Over the weekend I attended OWASP AppSec Ireland 2010 at Trinity College in Dublin. The event was a full day event held on the 17th September starting at 9AM and 'officially' ending at 9PM. On my first night in Dublin I went for an excellent Italian meal with some great people, these include <a href="http://www.twitter.com/securityninja" target="_blank">@securityninja</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Angelill0" target="_blank">@Angelill0, </a><a href="http://www.twitter.com/danielcornell" target="_blank">@danielcornell</a> and others. The evening was polished off with a traditional pint of Guiness in a local pub.

On the day of the conference I arrived a little early and had some brief discussions with a couple of the attendees. The conference kicked off with the keynote talk by John Viega titled "Application Security in the Real World". This was an excellent talk that put into perspective the reality of application security within business. The keynote was followed by a brief unplanned summary by Samy Kamkar on his talk which he is touring Europe with. I look forward to seeing his full talk at BruCON next weekend.

Dropbox has become very popular and widely used as it has so many different uses and makes file sharing over the internet easy. Dropbox allows you to make public image galleries, share files publicly, share files between computers and manage version control. All this straight from your file system. I like to think of it as git or a subversion repository with a nice interface.

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            It's not often I interview people for the blog however when some one catches my eye and raises my interest I like to find out more about them and share it with my readers. This time I interviewed 'The Jester'. The Jester has been in the media spotlight recently for taking down Jihadist terrorist web sites via use of a targeted DoS attacks. 

<strong>* Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do?</strong>

Ryan, I would like to give you and your readers a little more about me but it's kind of difficult to do that, given the nature of my targets, all I can give you sir is what's already 'out there' - I am ex-mil - and slightly pissed at the surge in Jihadist online activities.

Now with regard to what I do: I aim to cause disruption to the online efforts of Jihadists on the internet. They have realized that they can recruit, train and coordinate home-grown terrorists completely via the internet, without ever having to meet. This cuts out much of the risk associated with any face-to-face contact for the recruiters. Web recruitment targets young, tech-savvy, vulnerable Muslims, the iPod generation if you like. By making these sites unreliable, the potential recruit numbers start to dwindle. I limit my hits to defined time-slots (rather than killing them completely) because I am well aware that official Counter Terrorist Agencies use some of these sites for intelligence gathering. I have been asked why I DON'T hit certain sites, well it's simple. By NOT hitting certain sites (and hitting others hard) I am 'herding', people give up easily when a site is constantly up and down, and move on to a more reliable one. So it creates a funnel-effect, funneling terrorists and potential terrorists away from peripheral sites and into a smaller space that is easier to monitor.

            A white paper released recently (not dated) by the University of California titled ‘Why Johnny Can’t Pentest: An Analysis of Black-box Web Vulnerability Scanners’ evaluates eleven commercial and open-source black-box web vulnerability scanners.

The three authors of the paper (Adoupe, Marco, Vigna) test the black-box scanners against their custom vulnerable web application they called WackoPicko. Their custom web application contained a number of different technical and business logic vulnerabilities, both authenticated and un-authenticated. 

They tested each scanner against WackoPicko in three different modes. Initial (point-and-click), Config (login credentials/mechanism provided) and Manual (local proxy use). The eleven scanners tested were Acunetix, Appscan, Burp, Grendel-Scan, Hailstorm, Milescan, N-Stalker, NTOSpider, Paros, w3af and Webinspect.

            Every now and then I like to visit black-hat community forums for a number of legitimate reasons. I like to see what the other side are up to, what they are buying/selling, at what price, who they are targeting, the skill level of the attackers, what exploitation techniques they use, etc. Visiting these underground community forums passively can be a great learning experience.

I had read stories about servers or web servers more specifically being targeted over personal computers for their use in DDoS attacks. Using a server rather than a client as a zombie means that the attackers have higher bandwidth,  RAM, CPU and other resources at their disposal. Servers are generally more secure than clients as you would expect the people who set them up and manage them have a greater awareness of the risks involved. Although servers are generally more difficult to compromise, compromising 100 servers may be worth more than 1000 clients.

While browsing a particular black-hat community forum I came across a post by a user who wanted to purchase compromised web servers and made a particular request that the servers should have his supplied PHP script pre-uploaded.

<blockquote>"A web bug is an object that is embedded in a web page  or e-mail  and is usually invisible to the user but allows checking that a user has viewed the page or e-mail. One common use is in e-mail tracking. Alternative names are web beacon, tracking bug, tracking pixel, pixel tag, 1×1 gif, and clear gif."</blockquote>

At the time I thought I had stumbled across something unique and that no one had really understood the implications of allowing the posting of remote images in web applications. The idea originally came to me when playing around with Adrian Crenshaw's (<a href="http://www.irongeek.com/">IronGeek</a>) logo. I wasn't aware of the term 'web bug' so I explained to Adrian my concept, he knew what a web bug was and seemed to be well aware of their consequences.

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            DevBUG is an idea that came to me while conducting a Vulnerability Assessment for University a few months back. We did a service scan on a web server and found that way too many ports and services were running! But that wasn't the problem, well, not for us anyway. The problem was, is that we had 20 different software services and versions to google and write about.

So what is the process? We needed to find the software package's homepage, find what the latest version of the package is for the development tree that was used, find out how old the version the web server was running was and then try to find any known vulnerabilities associated with that version. This is not too much hassle when you have to do it one to three times however when you have to do it twenty to fifty times it starts to become time consuming.

So in comes DevBUG. DevBUG is a web application which will be free for any one to use, no subscriptions or anything. It will be a search engine for software packages and their versions. Three times a day (every 8 hours) starting at 8AM GMT a backed spider will visit every software package's homepage looking for new versions, if it finds a new version this will be added to a database. So the idea is, to keep a record of software, their released versions, release dates and any vulnerabilities which may affect each version. So this is great to solve our original problem! We have a one stop shop for all the information we need! But what other uses does it have?

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            In the Information Security industry it is said that if you have security clearance you can earn significantly more income and work on exiting secret projects for government agencies. So what is security clearance and how do I get it?

Security clearance is a way to prove your trustworthiness at a particular point in time so that you can work with sensitive information on government projects. Your trustworthiness is assessed by a thorough background check. There are a number of different security clearance levels depending on the sensitivity of the information which you are required to work with. These levels were changed in the UK during WWII to reflect those of the US so that sensitive information could be shared and the sensitivity of the information not be confused.

<strong>National Security Clearances:</strong>

<blockquote><strong>Developed Vetting (DV) </strong>
This is the highest level of Security Clearance and is required for people with substantial unsupervised access to TOP SECRET assets, or for working in the intelligence or security agencies. This level of clearance involves Security Check (SC) and, in addition, completion of a (DV) questionnaire, financial checks, checking of references and a detailed interview with a vetting officer. To gain (DV) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 10 years.
 
<strong>Security Check (SC)</strong> is for people who have substantial access to SECRET, or occasional access to TOP SECRET assets and information. This level of clearance involves a (BPSS) check plus UK criminal and security checks and a credit check. To gain (SC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 5 years.

<strong>Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)</strong> is required for personnel whose work involves close proximity to public figures, gives access to information or material vulnerable to terrorist attack or involves unrestricted access to certain government or commercial establishments. A (CTC) does not allow access, or knowledge, or custody, of protectively marked assets and information. The check includes a Baseline Personnel Security Standard Check (BPSS) and also a check against national security records. To gain (CTC) clearance you will normally have had to have been a resident in the UK for a minimum of 3 years.

<strong>Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</strong> (formally Basic Check)and Enhanced Baseline Standard (EBS) (formerly Enhanced Basic Check or Basic Check +): These are not formal security clearances; they are a package of pre-employment checks that represent good recruitment and employment practice.
A BPSS or EBS aims to provide an appropriate level of assurance as to the trustworthiness, integrity, and probable reliability of prospective employees.  The check is carried out by screening identity documents and references.</blockquote>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            In 2007 the <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/">Hardened-PHP Project</a> setup by three German Security Researchers organised the Month of PHP Bugs (MOPB). The 'Month of Bugs' concept was started by non other than HD Moore back in 2006 with his Month of Browser Bugs (MoBB) which found security holes within most of the popular browsers. Since then there have been many 'Month's of Bugs' including <a href="http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/">Month of Kernel Bugs (MoKB)</a>, <a href="http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/">Month of Apple Bugs</a>, <a href="http://twitpwn.com/">Month of Twitter Bugs</a> and the <a href="http://theharmonyguy.com/2009/09/15/the-month-of-facebook-bugs-halfway-report/">Month of Facebook Bugs</a>.

<strong>So why a Month of Bugs?</strong>
"The intention of the Month of PHP Security is to gather the best research and articles about PHP security topics from the security community and share them with the rest of the world. This time the goal is not only to improve the security of PHP itself and applications directly by fixing security bugs, but also to help PHP developers around the world to write better and more secure PHP applications."
