  post: Current Available UK Degrees</a> by 1337speak in April last year. I have decided
  to update the list as to keep the information up to date.\r\n\r\nYou who know me
  will know that I my self am enrolled on one of these University courses. I believe
  that if you're starting out in security and want to make a career out of it this
  may be the best place to start. For me the course has done wonders, not only in
  what I have learnt however the people I've met and the drive it has given me to
  succeed in my chosen career.\r\n\r\n"

<p>I have surprised myself at how many courses are actually out there! Most of the courses have started in the past 3 years and will be starting in the next 2. It looks like there will be a lot more job competition in the next 5-10 years in the security industry. That's OK, it will keep me on my toes. It seems information security in the UK is starting to become widespread and this can only be a good thing in the long run.</p>
<p>The listed courses above are for BSc university degrees, there are also MSc security courses and others out there which I have not listed.</p>
