<p>We are glad to finally be able to let you all know that ScreenStamp! is nearly ready for release and that we are looking for BETA testers!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is ScreenStamp!?</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! is a project that I, 1337speak and cpbx have been working on for the past couple of months. Its aim is to be a fully automated screenshot application that will be available for Windows, Linux and eventually Mac's.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another screenshot application??? Aren't there enough out there??</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are lots of screenshot applications out there, however there is none that we could find that did exactly what we wanted. The idea came to us when recently undergoing a information gathering and vulnerability assessment, we had to capture screenshots of all the information that we had gathered in order to represent it as evidence. Every one in the group of 5 had at least 50 screenshots each, which all had to be captured, saved to an image editing application, date/timed, named and then saved to a file location on the hard drive. This proved to take a very long time when taking lots of screenshots!</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does ScreenStamp! do?</strong></p>
<p>It has been designed to be as fully automated as possible, non intrusive, easy to use/install and free. Here are some of the features:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Takes a screenshot from the PrtSc button on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Puts date/time onto the image.</p>
<p>Names and saves the image to a preset location.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where can I download it?</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! Linux and Win are almost finished, we are now looking for BETA testers to find bugs and recommend improvements. If you are interested in being a BETA tester, please email development&lt;A&gt;screenstamp.co.uk and indicate which version you would like to test, Linux, WIndows or both.</p>
