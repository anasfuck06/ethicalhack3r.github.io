<p>Within the UK there is, that I have been able to find only three universities offering a variation of Ethical Hacking Degrees;</p>

<p>When the course at Northumbria was in the development stages there was even media attention drawn to it, as the name before it's change was simply "Ethical Hacking" although I could not fins the story surrounding it's name <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2008/02/06/ethical_hacking_feature.shtml">here</a> is a link to a story on the subject itself. Funnily enough there is also a blog post on it although not many replies it shows how much attention the thought of people learning to hack has brought about. <a class="postlink" href="http://slipouts.blogspot.com/2008/09/ethical-hacking-degree-certified.html">Blog Post</a>.</p>

Regardless of the attention that the subject receives there is still a great demand for security professionals within many industries, I was at a Business risk management conference, at the end of this month and as was quite surprised at the lack of knowledge business people had in regards to what data could be found on the internet, and how insecure any server can be if not maintained and configured correctly. Ethical Hackers are needed not only to Information Gather--&gt;Carry out vulnerability tests--&gt;and Penetration testing but also to educate people and companies. The degrees provided in the UK are a great way for Ethical Hackers to start off and be recognised to have the knowledge to do this, along with other certifications available.</p>

<p>I hope this information is useful to people looking into university courses at the moment, please feel free to ask any questions regarding the Northumbria course as I am currently on it .</p>
