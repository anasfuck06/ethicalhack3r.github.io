            <p>Ive just finished coding a wordpress version fingerprinting plugin for w3af so I thought id let you all know what w3af is and how you can contribute too.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>w3af is a Web Application Attack and Audit Framework. The project's goal is to create a framework to find and exploit web application vulnerabilities that is easy to use and extend.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
Any serious security professional should have w3af in their tool kit, w3af can discover, evade, audit and exploit web application vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The plugin I developed (wordpress_fingerprint) scans wordpress installations for their version. It does this by first checking that wordpress is installed, if it is it will check to see if the version is in the index header source code and will then go through a list of fingerprinting data. The plugin will find the version even if there is a security plugin installed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>To contribute to w3af:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When the course at Northumbria was in the development stages there was even media attention drawn to it, as the name before it's change was simply "Ethical Hacking" although I could not fins the story surrounding it's name <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2008/02/06/ethical_hacking_feature.shtml">here</a> is a link to a story on the subject itself. Funnily enough there is also a blog post on it although not many replies it shows how much attention the thought of people learning to hack has brought about. <a class="postlink" href="http://slipouts.blogspot.com/2008/09/ethical-hacking-degree-certified.html">Blog Post</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">'<br />
</span><br />
Regardless of the attention that the subject receives there is still a great demand for security professionals within many industries, I was at a Business risk management conference, at the end of this month and as was quite surprised at the lack of knowledge business people had in regards to what data could be found on the internet, and how insecure any server can be if not maintained and configured correctly. Ethical Hackers are needed not only to Information Gather--&gt;Carry out vulnerability tests--&gt;and Penetration testing but also to educate people and companies. The degrees provided in the UK are a great way for Ethical Hackers to start off and be recognised to have the knowledge to do this, along with other certifications available.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I hope this information is useful to people looking into university courses at the moment, please feel free to ask any questions regarding the Northumbria course as I am currently on it .</p>

            <p>We are glad to finally be able to let you all know that ScreenStamp! is nearly ready for release and that we are looking for BETA testers!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is ScreenStamp!?</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! is a project that I, 1337speak and cpbx have been working on for the past couple of months. Its aim is to be a fully automated screenshot application that will be available for Windows, Linux and eventually Mac's.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another screenshot application??? Aren't there enough out there??</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are lots of screenshot applications out there, however there is none that we could find that did exactly what we wanted. The idea came to us when recently undergoing a information gathering and vulnerability assessment, we had to capture screenshots of all the information that we had gathered in order to represent it as evidence. Every one in the group of 5 had at least 50 screenshots each, which all had to be captured, saved to an image editing application, date/timed, named and then saved to a file location on the hard drive. This proved to take a very long time when taking lots of screenshots!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does ScreenStamp! do?</strong></p>
<p>It has been designed to be as fully automated as possible, non intrusive, easy to use/install and free. Here are some of the features:</p>

            <p>Just to let everyone know that we are now running the latest version of wordpress, finally! If you haven't noticed already there's a 'Security Jobs' RSS feed which grabs RSS feeds off a number of job sites, the link can be found in the sidebar above the google ads.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
Ive fixed the footer as it was out of line and also made the pagination a little bit nicer however during the process of updating the site I seem to have messed up the 'pages', the ones in the green bar at the top. Haven't a clue whats gone wrong, spent the past few hours staring at CSS, PHP and HTML and still cannot figure out what I have done!!! I'm going to leave it for now and come back to it another day.<br />

            Abstract:
Any one can post an image anywhere that allows the posting of remote images, grab the http header information of any one who views the image and save it to a log file on a remote server. This has been done for a while by the advertisement industry to track users activities. It can also be used by mail clients to check that an email has been read by the recipient. It is known as a 'web bug'.

I will be posting about my views regarding BBC Click Online hacking into botnets, using them to carry out tests and then changing the computers wallpapers to make the users aware that they were zombies. Is that legal? I will be posting about this over the next few days.<br />

            <p>During our last information gathering and vulnerability assessment project our team realised that the IP address and web server software had changed from when we initially started out. Some time during the project the IT department had changed servers, which meant that some of our data from before the change was now obsolete.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Some one on our team came up with an idea for a program that would monitor the server for any changes and notify us when it had happened. We would then know as soon as possible and could document this in our final report.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The following Python code checks the web server every hour for changes in IP address, HTTP server header and x-powered-by header. If it notices any change it logs it to a log file aptly named log.txt.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>

<p>Cant seem to find a change-log as yet, I think it has only been released in the past few hours. It was pre-released at Shmoocon 2009 a couple of weeks ago. I haven't downloaded and tested BT4 however I will definitely be taking a look once I have some spare time. Download it and let us know what you think!</p>

            <p>Just bought an Acer Aspire One! It cost me £150 from ASDA (instore only), here are the specs:</p>
<p>OS: Linpus Lite (Linux)</p>
<p>RAM: 512MB</p>
<p>HDD: IDE 1.8" 160GB</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Atom N270  											1.6 GHz</p>
<p>Display: 8.9" 1024x600</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-146" title="acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop" src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop-300x257.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>The keyboard is not too small, it has a normal sized UK enter button, screen size is fine and its very light. You can buy a 1GB RAM stick that only costs £10 from crucial however to fit it you have to pull the whole machine apart. Why didnt they just install a flap at the base of the machine for easy access? God knows! I havent upgraded the RAM yet however I am considering it. The default user interface is designed for babies however migrating to the 'advanced' mode and the XFCE desktop was only a few clicks away. Linpus Lite comes with the XFCE desktop enviroment which I think is fine, I may change to another Linux distro in the future.</p>
